           <h2>An Informal Casual Travel Blog</h2>
           <p> I go on some trips a couple of times a year and I figured that I would start 
            documenting my experiences. Whenever I go somewhere I eat food, drink water and 
            breathe every second I am on earth. It is super fun to travel thousand of miles 
            and I laugh. I also sleep when I travel. Some people may think that it is a 
            waste of time to sleep but it's pretty good for you. 
           </p>
           <p>When I travel I pack clothes, bring money and stay aware. I also make sure to 
            plan out my flight beforehand so I know what country and place I am traveling to.
            Otherwise it could be terrible not knowing where I am going. If I am lost or 
            anything, I wouldn't know what to do. So I bring my cellphone with me as well since
            it is such a valuable resource.
