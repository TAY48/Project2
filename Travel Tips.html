        <h2>Always Pack Clothes</h2>
        <img src="Clothes.jpg">
        <p>It is vital to bring clothes with you, otherwise you will only have one set of clothing to wear. 
           Then you will have to buy more clothes on the trip or do laundry everyday. 
           Shopping in a foreign country may take up valuable time when you could eat or gain other new experiences.

        <h2>Bring Money with You</h2>
        <img src="Money.jpg">
        <p>It is smart to bring money with you since it can buy things for you everywhere in the world.
            If you try to get something without using money, they may accuse you of stealing.
            Therefore just make sure to bring money in order to have a fun time.
            Nothing is free.

        <h2>Be Aware</h2>
        <img src="Aware.jpg">
        <p>It is important to be viligant since you are in a new land and you don't know the culture.
            So just make sure to look around and that no one is trying to harm you. 
            If they are trying to harm you, run far far away and never return.
